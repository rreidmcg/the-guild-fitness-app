RPG Fitness App Development Brief

App Title (Working):

The Forge: RPG Fitness Tracker

⸻

Core Concept:

A free-to-play RPG-themed fitness tracking app where users earn XP and level up by doing real workouts. Every workout contributes experience points that improve both the player’s character level and individual stat levels (Strength, Stamina, Agility). Players can battle monsters, equip gear, earn loot, unlock abilities, and challenge other players in PvP — all based on their real-world training.

⸻

User Account System:
	•	Secure sign-up with email/password or social login (Google, Apple, etc.)
	•	Unique usernames
	•	User profiles displaying avatar, stat levels, XP progress, gear, titles, and achievements

⸻

Leveling and Stat Progression:
	1.	Player Leveling System:

	•	Workouts provide XP that increases the player’s character level
	•	The XP curve increases with each level to slow progress over time
	•	Goal: reaching level 50 should take about one year with an average of 5 workouts per week
	•	No level cap currently, but scalable backend required

	2.	Stat Progression:

	•	Stats include Strength, Stamina, and Agility
	•	Each stat has its own XP bar and levels up independently
	•	Exercises award XP to different stats depending on type (e.g., lifting increases Strength, running increases Stamina)
	•	Stats level up using a curve similar to player levels to avoid inflated numbers
	•	Stat levels affect battle performance (e.g., Strength increases damage)

⸻

Fitness Tracking Features:
	•	Custom workout logging (sets, reps, RPE, time, tags)
	•	Tag exercises to auto-assign XP to stats (already programmed)
	•	Track weekly volume and historical progress
	•	Automatically track personal records (1RMs, best times, etc.)
	•	Graphs for progress over time
	•	Achievements for workout streaks, PRs, volume milestones, and challenge completions

⸻

Monster Progression and Player Tiers:
	1.	Monster Tier Structure:

	•	Tiers: E, D, C, B, A, S
	•	Each tier includes 30 to 35 monsters
	•	Every 10th monster is a boss or mini-boss with increased HP, attack, or evasion
	•	Bosses serve as skill checks for stat development and consistency
	•	Defeating the final boss of each tier unlocks the next tier

	2.	Player Tiers:

	•	Players are ranked by the highest tier of monsters they have completed
	•	Tier progression ranks:
	•	Recruit: Tier E
	•	Fighter: Tier D
	•	Warrior: Tier C
	•	Champion: Tier B
	•	Hero: Tier A
	•	Legend: Tier S

	3.	Boss Rewards:

	•	Bosses drop enhanced loot and award titles
	•	Titles are cosmetic and can be displayed on the profile
	•	Examples: “Breaker of Beasts,” “Ash-Bound Warrior,” “Champion of Tier C”

⸻

Combat System and Abilities:
	1.	Battle System:

	•	Turn-based combat

	2.	Skill Progression:

	•	New abilities unlock as players progress through tiers
	•	Ability examples:

	•	Evasion Boost: increase dodge rate temporarily
	•	Healing: restore a percentage of HP
	•	Players can equip a limited number of active skills per battle (e.g., 3 to 4)

	3.	Ultimate Ability:

	•	Players charge a combo meter by logging workouts or taking turns in battle
	•	Once full, they can unleash a powerful skill
	•	Ultimate examples:
	•	High-damage attack
	•	Teamwide stat buff
	•	Full-heal or dodge-all effect
