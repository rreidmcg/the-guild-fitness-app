# How to Get a Magic Link for Demo Access

## For Admin Users:

1. **Access the Demo Admin Panel:**
   - Navigate to: `/demo-admin` in your browser
   - You must be logged in with admin privileges (G.M. title)

2. **Generate Magic Link:**
   - Enter a description (e.g., "External Security Audit - Q1 2025")
   - Click "Generate Magic Link"
   - Copy the generated URL

3. **Share with External Auditors:**
   - Send the magic link via secure communication
   - Link expires in 24 hours
   - Single-use only (becomes invalid after first access)

## For Non-Admin Users:

If you need a demo link but don't have admin access, ask an admin user to generate one for you.

## What the Demo Link Provides:

- **Automatic Login:** No credentials needed
- **Pre-populated Demo Account:**
  - Level 3 character with sample progression
  - Basic equipment and currency
  - Completed onboarding flow
  - Sample workout data and achievements

## Security Features:

- ✅ 24-hour expiration
- ✅ Single-use tokens
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of demo accounts
- ✅ No access to real user data
- ✅ Isolated demo environment

## Example Magic Link Format:
```
https://your-app-domain.replit.app/demo/abc123xyz456
```

The demo user is automatically created with realistic data to showcase the full application functionality without compromising real user information.
